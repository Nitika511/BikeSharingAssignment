## General Information
- This is a case study assignment for building and analyzing a Linear regression model.
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

The objective of this project is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 
- The dataset being used are provided by upgrad.


## Conclusions
- As per the Linear Regession model, it can be concluded that the demand for Bikes was impacted by temperature, windspeed and pre-covid time period.
- Hence the Bike Sharing provider can plan their bike availability based on these parameters.



## Technologies Used
- Python 3.11
- Seaborn & Matplotlib for data visualization
- Statsmodels api for Linear Regression
